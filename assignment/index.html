        <ul>
            <li>I was a music major in college and won the opportunity to 
                play a marimba concerto with the Concordia Orchestra (which
                was rather terrifying but really fun!)
            </li>
            <li>
                I have been to Greece twice and even spent a few days in Turkey
                on one of those trips.
            </li>
            <li>
                I once tried to read 'War and Peace' just to say I did it...but 
                but it wasn't good enough to justify the time it would
                take to finish. So I stopped at the end of part one and called it 
                good.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <p class="quote">"The question...is not whether you will love, hurt, dream, and die. 
                It is what you will love, why you will hurt, when you will dream, and how you will die. 
                This is your choice. You cannot pick the destination, only the path."
                -from <strong>'Oathbringer'</strong> by Brandon Sanderson

                To choose a favorite quoteis nearly impossible, as it requires an extensive knowledge

                But this one <strong>is</strong> quite good. And from one of my favorite books.
