Git status shows the status of your files and commits. If a file has been changed but not added for committing,
it will display in red. All added files will display in green. It helps you keep track of what file
changes you have completed and are ready to commit, and which ones you still need to add, or maybe edit before adding.

# 9 - What does the command 'git add .' do?

Git add stages a file (or folder) so it is ready to be committed on the next commit command.
